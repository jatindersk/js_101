// The solution has a missing break statement for each of the cases's in the
// switch statement from line 22. For example, when value of result variable
// is 1, it matches the first case defined on line 23. The corresponding clause
// gets executed. However, due to a missing break statement the program flow
// follows through to the next case clause and so on until the default case.
// Therefore, all the outcomes are displayed for the roll.
